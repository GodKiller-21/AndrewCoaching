                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                    <p>Chichester College Group Chief Executive Andrew Green is passionate changing lives through learning and about Further Education (FE) and has the pedigree to prove it.

                        Having begun his career in retail management, working for companies including House of Fraser and Boots, Andrew retrained as a teacher in 1996 and gained his Masters in Education in 2000.
                        
                        His career in FE began at this time, and he held a range of senior positions at City College, Brighton and Hove, before taking up the post of Deputy Principal at Chichester College in 2010.
                        
                        He was then appointed Executive Principal in 2017, following the college’s merger with Crawley College and the creation of the Chichester College Group. He was named Chief Executive in 2021.
                        
                        During his career at Chichester College Group (formerly Chichester College), he has led the group through two Outstanding Ofsted inspections in 2014 and 2020.
                        
                        Andrew is passionate about building the skills and confidence in young people, apprentices and adults, giving them the routes to their dream job or dream university place and giving them the tools they need to be able to make a positive contribution to their local communities.
                        
                        Away from the ‘day job’, Andrew was the joint owner and chief executive of Brighton Film School from 2011 until 2018. He served as a director of a retail local boutique in Chichester for 5 years, currently runs a property company and a leadership coaching company “The Authentic Leadership Coach Limited”.
                        
                        Andrew is also a trustee of two charities – Culture Shift, which uses the arts to positively change the lives of young people and adults with learning difficulties and disabilities, and PACSO, which provides respite care for parents of children with learning difficulties or disabilities.</p>
